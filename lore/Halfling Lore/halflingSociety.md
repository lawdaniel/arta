The Six Septs of Saruata
Maan Tivra
Maan Antara
Maan Kori

Dha Shuddha
Dha Gani
Dha Cacali

The Maan septs mostly believe in non-violence and being at peace with their natural surroundings.

The Dha Septs mostly believe in confronting conflict head-on and believe that peace is achieved through active resolution.

In modern Halfling society, the six septs generally keep to themselves. There are active trading routes between many of the septs but skirmishes over land and natural resources still pop up from time to time. Especially when the conflict arises between Dha septs. It is no surprise that the Maan septs tend to be smaller and care for smaller areas when compared to Dha septs.
