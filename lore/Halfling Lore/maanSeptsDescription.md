The Three "Maan" Septs of Halfling Society 

Maan Tivra
Maan Antara
Maan Kori

**A recap:** There are six remaining septs of Halfling society. The other three are the "Dha" septs. All septs have a variety of differences but they are grouped by how they choose to interact with their world.  The "maan" septs are not known for their military strength but rather their connection to the natural world.  Do not think of them as just spirtualists and pacifists. They still have martial classes such as fighters and rogues among them but their motivations are different. For example. A maan rogue's view of martial combat is that it's a natural extension of song and dance. In fact, many young maan rogues may begin their training with a decade under a ballet master before wielding the blade. 

Today, we will go over a brief overview of Sept Maan Kori.

Sept Maan Kori has a much deeper connection to the natural sounds of our world. Their young are encouraged from an early age to indulge and interact with nature's many songs. It would not be surprising to see young maan kori halflings, once they were done with their farming chores for the day, singing alongside a stream as they attempted to match their song with the water's. The sept believed that the sounds of nature were something for all living creatures to live in harmony with. This is the underlying philosophy that bound all Maan Kori halflings together.

There are few martial classes in Sept Maan Kori but they are not completely absent. Most adventurers that emerge from this sept tend to be bards, druids, or clerics. Though you will find that any person who seeks to find meaning in the song of our world can find a home in Sept Maan Kori.

The current neta of Maan Kori is Raga (RAH-gah) Maan Kori. Raga's pronouns are they/them. Raga is well regarded among their sept and is seen as a wise and thoughtful leader.
