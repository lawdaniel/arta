# Miscellaneous Bits of Lore and Roleplay

## Andardsil's Sorrow
*A popular song sung by many bards and performers. It's a slow sad song.*

<p>My love is gone, her whispers fade<br>
carried away by my mistake.<br>
My love is gone, her whispers ring<br>
through the land, are my mistakes.</p>

<br>

## Oh Vanané
*Halfling nursery rhyme used often to calm a child when they've hurt themselves. This has been translated into Common.*

<p>Oh Vanané<br>
a note so pure<br>
to render the shadows<br>
from Mordwen's tear<br>
hear our cries<br>
sing us your note<br>
silence our tear<br>
oh Vanané</p>
