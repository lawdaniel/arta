# Excerpt from the account of the Vera, according to the Lore of the Elves.

In the beginning, Urim, the One, resounded a perfect sound. Urim’s perfect sound went out and created the heavens, bringing forth the Vera into existence. The Vera were of Urim’s thoughts and before aught else was made, they worshiped Urim for that perfect sound.  

And Urim sang a second perfect sound, that blazed through the empty darkness, bringing forth light. Urim’s second sound separated the light from the darkness, creating the first day. They became enamored of its beauty and heard the beginning and unfolding as unto a vision. The Vera worshiped at Urim’s feet.  

Then Urim sang onto the Vera a portion of his flame eternal. The Vera began to sing as Urim and though they were of Urim, their music could naught but be apart of the great music, each based on to their own measure. Many of the Vera sang in harmony to Urim, while some at first sang with fervor, but soon faded into the echoing silence. And still others, thinking themselves capable of greater music than that of Urim, began to sing in discordance to the other Vera.

Mordwen was one such Vera, whose powerful measure brought lesser Vera into his discordance. Chief among the Vera, and the one most in tune to Urim, was Emberway. Soon a clash of music began, some of the Vera, led by Emberway, was harmonious, filled with joy and light. While others, whose music was led by Mordwen, strode in deep tones, harsh and droll, a pale imitation of the perfect sound. What the Vera did not know was that Urim was the author of all, and while the discordance seemed in harsh contrast, it was still a part of Urim’s perfect sound.

Therefore Urim, gave unto their song, the form of the world, and set it amidst the void, alight by the fire of day.
  

And then Urim sang a third perfect sound, that sent forth his fire eternal into the world, to burn at its heart, and it was called Arta. In the tongue of Elves it is called Caladen.

The Vera saw this flame eternal and looked to Urim for his will. Urim’s fire beckoned unto the Vera, those who desired it, and some stood and went into the World at the beginning of Time. It was their task to achieve and to labor for a time, bringing forth the beauty of Urim’s song. Long they labored in the regions of Arta, which are vast beyond the reckoning of Elves and Men, until the time appointed. Then they put on the raiment of Arta and descended into it, and dwelt therein.
