# The Tale of Andardstil and Ellamar

Of all the tales that came before our dark times, comes a story filled with joy and sorrow, of love and woe, and of folly and ruin.  This is the tale of Andardsil and Ellamar.  Legends tell of Andardsil’s greatness, but not by bow and sword, but as a bard, a poet, and a prophet.  For in those days none could match Andardsil’s gift of verse and song.  It is said that when he played, all the world quieted to listen and the Vera wept at its sound.  For his voice was the most liken onto Urim anyone would ever hear on Arta.

Andardsil went on many adventures with many famous heroes of our past.  Mighty deeds that would have failed were it not for Andardsil’s gift.  It was during one of these adventures that Andardsil came upon a fair elven maiden in the woods, singing a tune that the very birds of the sky echoed.  He approached the fair maiden, softly strumming his lyre, singing a melody to accompany her song.  This was pleasing to the fair maiden and she in turn began to sing with her whole heart.  This moved Andardsil, and he wept at such beauty.  They attuned their voices to each other and as one they sang in pure harmony.  The coarse sounds of the world became still, and time stopped its ever onward flow, to bear witness to perfection.  Ellamar was the maiden’s name, and it was she in whom Andardsil ceased his adventuring days, to forevermore sing his songs with her in happiness.

This was before the war of the Vera when Mordwen still roamed the land.  And like all others he heard their music and at once was moved by their song.  So moved was he that a single tear fell from his eyes.  This angered Mordwen, for his heart was full of malice.  So he bent down and picked up the fallen tear, vile and black as pitch it was, poisoning the very ground where it fell.  He took notice of Andardsil and Ellamar, including them in his evil machinations, vowing to destroy their happiness.

For three centuries did Andardsil and Ellamar join as one in mind, body, spirit, and song.  They traveled the lands spreading their happiness and entertaining the freefolk of the world.  It was not until the birth of their child Vanané that the pair settled down in the town of Glírothrond, along the western shores.

When they ceased their wanderings is when Mordwen set into motion his plans.  It took many labors by Mordwen to craft the first plague elvenkind had ever known.  Swift and deadly it came, felling both young and old, the strong and the wise, the spiteful and the penitent alike.  Both Ellamar and Vanané were stricken with the sickness, like death they seemed.  Andardsil was beside himself in worry and grief, for his songs could soothe them and uplift their spirit, but it could not cure them.

That is when Mordwen came to Andardsil, in the guise of a young woman, who was said to be wise in the arts of healing.  Fair, with eyes as blue as the sea and hair the color of the setting sun.  Her counsel was wise and her words like honey.

“They say your voice is liken unto Urim the creator.  If Urim could make Arta with but a sound, then surely your gift can unmake this plague.” said Mordwen.

“I cannot! My gift can uplift the soul and mend the body, but it does not affect this plague.” said Andardsil, anger and worry lacing his words.

“Ah, then perhaps I can help.  I can make you a draught to strengthen your voice, allowing you to sing like never before.  For it is said that the whole world would stop to listen to you sing.  Surely with some help you can sing this plague away.”  Wise and persuasive were her words, though not if Andardsil was not in such distress.

“Please, give me your draught, and I will sing like never before!”

So Mordwen made a draught, putting his fallen tear drop into it at the last.  “When you are before your wife and daughter, drink this, and sing!”

Andardsil did as he was told.  He stood before his ailing wife and daughter, drank the bitter draught, and sang.  At first his words were soft and melodious, testing his gift.  He could feel warmth flow through him, an amplification of his voice.  Taking in a deep breath, Andardsil began to sing in earnest.  This is when Mordwen’s plans had at last come to fruition, for Andardsil’s gift was no longer his own.  Dissonant sounds of anger and lament ushered forth from Andardsil, a destructive wave of pain and terror overtook all who could hear.  He could not stop, for the corruption had taken over his gift.  Tears fell from Andardsil at his folly and at the madness he was unleashing upon his people.

Weak in body, but strong in heart, Ellamar pleaded with Andardsil to stop.  She began to sing a song of peace and serenity to interfere with his song.  But weak as she was, her voice was as a whisper to his roar.  It was Vanané however who broke through his curse, the gifted daughter of both Andardsil and Ellamar.  She sang a song of the unconditional love of a child for their parents, a simple tune that touches the heart.  This broke the spell over Andardsil and at once he ceased his song.  Coughing and choking, Andardsil spat out the black teardrop, shattering it onto the ground.

Ellamar and Vanané, having spent their last breath, passed into the waiting world beyond.

Andardsil, surveying the destruction he had caused and the still forms of his wife and daughter, was overcome with grief.  He had unleashed madness into the world and was filled with it now.  He cried out once more, not in song, but in a discordance of rage and pain.  He cried out with such force that he tore the veil between the planes, just as he tore the strands of his voice.  Andardsil would never sing again, as monsters came, heeding his cry of pain.
