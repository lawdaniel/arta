# Homebrew Potions
For this campaign Norm has created few new homebrew options to try out.

- Drinking potions - If your action is not an Attack or Spell Cast, you can use your bonus action to drink a potion.  ie.  You take the dodge action, you can drink a healing potion with your bonus action.  If you cast Toll the Dead as an action, you cannot drink a potion with your bonus. 
- Sundering - As a Reaction - If you are hit with an attack, you can sacrifice your weapon, shield, or armor instead of taking that attack.  i.e. I roll a 20 to crit you, automatic hit, you were able to bring your weapon to brace it and it shatters the weapon is destroyed, but you don't take the attack. 
- Extra Effort - I'm including this one as a test.  You can push yourself to do more.  I like the idea that you can will yourself to fight harder and longer at a cost. 
  - Regain Spell Slot: As an Bonus Action you can take a level of exhaustion to regain a spell slot, you spend Hit Dice to determine the level of the slot (i.e. Spend two Hit Dice to regain a 2nd level spell slot)  If no Hit Dice are available you can't do this.
  - Regain Hit points: As a Bonus Action you can take a level of exhaustion to regain HP, you spend Hit Dice at a cost of 2 to 1.  (Spend two Hit Dice to regain HP one Hit Dice worth of HP)  If no Hit Dice are available you can expend it.
  - Regain Ki/Bardic Inspiration/Combat Superiority Dice: As a Bonus Action you can take a level of exhaustion to regain Ki points by spending Hit Dice at a cost of 2 Hit Dice for 1 Ki point/1 Bardic Inspiration Die/Combat Superiority Die.
