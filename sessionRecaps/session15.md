# Campaign 4 Session 15 Recap Notes
## Date played 01/05/2024

Adventure began in the Pit with a discussion on what to do.  Tim doesn't want to endanger anyone and is willing to go it alone.

The party stays together!

Komal-Re has developed a nervous tick due to madness.

Lance is questioned about his armor and admits it can't come off and avoids the question if he wants it off.

Planning the Heist! Pretend they are prisoners, Callen goes invisible, and the knots are dc 6 to escape them.  What could go wrong?

They enter the citadel lobby and convince the pigeon and some guards to get them prosthetic wings to use to fly the air draft tunnels.

They draw a lot attention to themselves as Lance fails the DC 10 to use the wings to fly, even with assistance and inspiration twice.

Convinced some guards to escort you all up to the office and gives Lance a lift.

Things go badly, Callen strikes.  Pandemonium ensues!  Lance fails his DC6 to get out of the loose knots, and Callen fails to help him remove DC6 knots.

Tried new initiative groups idea!  Plus we used the giant initiative board with the flimsy tripod.

Get into the office after dispatching the guards.  Find the safe and it's trapped and set to explode if they fail to open. Needs 2 people to open.  Callen and Tim must work together to unlock!  They succeed!

Discover a warlock pact book of shadows!

Discover a black disc that fails to be identified but causes Komal-Re to gain another madness.  Indefinite madness, needs a drink to feel sane.

Danny Talon has given his allegiance to a dark power to control and to protect Aramark.

Danny Talon returns to the office!
