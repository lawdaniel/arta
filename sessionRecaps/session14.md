# Campaign 4 session 14 Summary
## Date played 12/08/2023

The party teleported from Aldamere into the country of Aramark, home of the Aarakocra.

The scene before them are a group of domed cities providing climate control and instead of frigid cold temps, they are encompassed in tropical heat.  How else would a macaw type aarakocra survive in the cold mountains!

They encounter a dozen Aarakocra guards, blasted by a hypnotic pattern and surrender.  Stripped of their gear and garb they are taken to a nearby domed fort and thrown into the cells, awaiting the inquisitor.  They learn that the Aarakocra people have become more insular and have closed off their borders to ALL outsiders and have grown more militaristic, under the command of Tim’s uncle Head Regent and Sky Marshall Danny Talon.  The Sky Empress Illia Kakeki Uiekie (I name generated this) has not been seen in public for some time and primarily resides in the upper sections of the domed ziggurat.  She was just a child when Tim escaped.

Tim was taken to see the inquisitor and was severely beaten up.  Ultimately they were sentenced to life in the pits.  An old underground mine originally built by the dwarves.   With aid from Celeste who taps into her power and dominates the mind of one of the guards. She is growing in her power!

The construction is that of solid stonework and would have a maze of tunnels throughout the rest of the cities.

In the lower portion are elves who have lived down in the pits for generations, outsiders, and undesirables of the aarakocra, who had their wings sheared off to prevent escape.  A fight with a guard patrol and they encounter Vananae (Van-Nah-Nay) 

She informs them that her mission is seal the rifts that endanger this world.  She has spent her life’s mission to sealing them all.  Celeste is needed to do so.  By entering the rift Celeste can close them, but it is dangerous and she will need protectors as she does so.  The rift here has not yet been found but she believes is deeper into the pits.  She knows of another in the dwarven homeland of Dvorland.  And a third that she does not know where yet.  All three must be sealed before taking on the last and the first great rift in the great Northern wastes.

We ran out of time and forget to talk about Berdusk.  Will write up more about that.

Celeste is a descendant of Vananae.  All of Vananae’s children were shepharded by the Haven and bred until one with the right blend of powers was born.

If the party wants to save the sky empress, Vananae can teleport you all closer to the top of the Ziggurat.  rifts.

The party must decide if they want to spend the time reconciling the state in which Tim’s people have fallen into.  Some suggestions thrown out was challenging sky marshall danny talon to some trial by combat sorta thing but doing so in a big display.

Feel free to write up or discuss what you all would like to do!
