# Campaign 4 Session 16 Recap
## Date played 02/02/2024

The scene began in Danny Talon’s office.  RP Confrontation with Tim. Excellent RP!  Danny Talon has the party over a barrel with nearly 40 soldiers and the bodyguard, nicknamed Herman.

**The offer:** Face Danny’s champion in a trial by combat.  The whole party vs the bodyguard?  Seems like uneven odds?

Psychic communication between Tim, Komal-Re, Callen, and Aegir.  What are the options?

Lance and Koney are ushered into the room to reunite the party.

Tim touches the Black Disc and sees a vision.  He sees an epic battle raging with the freefolk of the world and the forces of the three dark Vera.  Mordwen its chief, Argolin, and a third unknown god have risen from the Abyss.  The other Vera are not there.  Everything seems hope;ess.  Argolin stares into Tim and offers him a place at her side.  Tim goes trippin on hallucinations.

The battle is an aerial combat with a single platform inside a massive dome.  With the party aided by flying harnesses that move slow.  Since everyone is moving at the speed of scooters, Herman easily outmaneuvers everyone and goes after Tim.

Koney and Komal-Re learn a lesson on concentration spells.  They don't mix.

Danny Talon enacts his coup.  Herman turns into his true form, an Adult White DRAGON!  The other guards turn into white wymlings and attack the gathered Parliament of Elders.  Things look bad!

Komal-Re puts on a light show! Faerie fire, Hypnotic Pattern, Hypnotic Pattern, Hypnotic Pattern!

Callen attacks with a flurry of psychic daggers! Too bad most of his attacks were just a bit outside!

Lance puts it all out there with everything he gots! With Komal-Re’s light show for a background, his radiant divine smites adds to the light show and puts a beating on the Dragon.

Aegir summons her rage.  Learns a measure of control and doesn’t grow in size but still lays a beating.  Her tanking gives the rogues their sneak attack.

Willow unleashes All the charges in the ring of the ram.  Cute but misses the mark!

Dragonbreath! Komal-Re and Tim are down.

Lance presses the attack, taking a step off the platform.  The dragon returns the pummeling with a massive crit, dropping Lance.  Lance Falls 100 feet, hard!

Komal-Re hero fashion runs and dives off the platform, 100ft straight down and uses his levitate spell to save himself and get within range of Lance.  Lance needs to succeed on a death saving throw one more time!

Tim confronts Danny Talon with a passionate plea, and realizes the spear is a control rod for the dragon

Situation: Bleak. Everyone is badly hurt. Lance has 2 failed death saves. Spell slots nearly depleted. Koney with his last 3rd level spell casts “Dispel Magic” on the collar.  He needs to make a spell  casting check as the spell on the collar is higher than 3rd level.  All hangs on this roll.  Koney succeeds!  Just barely beating the DC15.  Now the hard part.  Convincing a feral dragon to go after his captor.  Persuasion check! Natural 20!  Dragon turns on a dime and goes after Danny Talon!

Lance is still down, Komal-Re can’t get to him til next turn.  Lance has one more death saving throw to make.  In the Natural 1s fashion, he rolls an 11!

Success! 

**Reward:** Everyone levels to 7.  4-5 days of downtime.  Aramark agrees to aid Aldamere.  All hail the conquering heroes!
