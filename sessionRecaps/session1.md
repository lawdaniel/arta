# Raw notes from Dan:

Arrived in Myrtle. Halfway to Berdusk. 

100 ppl town. 

Blacksmith, trading post, tavern   

Tavern is called The Honeydew. We all entered and did our thing. 

  

Human lady, Possibly regal. Pretty. Sitting to the side of the tavern. Has bodyguards. Doesn't seem to talk but has a young lady that does talk for her. 

  

Festival of the Sun in Berdusk in a couple of weeks. This might be important to get to.  

  

Boy covered in blood comes in. "The Larson Boy" 

 

The farmhouse is littered with the dismembered bodies of the boy's family.  

 

Fought a monster in the house. 

 

Fought a gazer in the fields.  

 

Fought another monster as well. 

 

Used Sleep without completely understanding the spell and knocked out 2 allies. 

When sleeping (prone?), a melee attack is an automatic crit. 

 

Saved the sister. Why was their family targeted? Don't remember if this was answered.
