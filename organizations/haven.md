# The Haven
The Haven is not a race of the freefolk, but I felt it necessary to include them here.  They are an order of women, of any race, that has denounced their ties to family, country, and culture to join their order. They are the collectors of all arcane knowledge and keep their studies and their secrets close. No men are allowed within the sanctuary grounds without permission.  Even with a permission, none that I have ever heard, have gone farther than the entry` courtyard.

The Haven is located in a section of the city of Ohman, known simply as the sanctuary. The Haven is the ruling body of the city, and their word is law. This may seem rather draconian in nature, but with clean streets of paved stone, lush gardens around every corner, ornate fountains at each piazza, and stylish buildings of a fairly modern design, one can see its positives.

Men are allowed to work within the city itself, but fraternization with any members of the Haven are often a death sentence for both the man and the woman. All members of the Haven are perhaps some of the most powerful wizards the world has seen, and they keep order within Ohman with the harshest of penalties. If you’ve come to Ohman looking for peace and serenity, then you’re certainly welcome. If you’ve come looking for a good time, I’d advise looking elsewhere. 

## Additional info from Norm on 03/01/2023
They are a powerful organization made up entirely of female arcane casters.  They protect and take in women from any race and train the ones who have magical talent.  Generally seen as benevolent and helpful but also slightly terrifying.  They are seen as advisors and counselors to kings and various countries and maintain their own territory with an iron fist.  Beyond that little is known.  What their organizational structure and aims are as of yet unknown.

My notes for players: I don't want to give too much away but my original idea was that they are a sorta hybrid between the Bene Gesserit/Jedi Order.  They do have an agenda and goal to be revealed later.  Whether its nefarious or virtuous will be a matter of perspective.
