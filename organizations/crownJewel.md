# The Crown Jewels
## Thieves Guild of the kingdom of Aldamere

The Crown Jewels organization is the kingdom of Aldamere's most secretive and most well known thieves guild.  It's Black Diamond, Dietrich Bellonna, is head of the organization with an unknown number of rogue crews, operating in various towns and cities throughout the kingdom.  Dietrich delegates operations to his three jewels The Sapphire, The Ruby, and The Obsidian.

The Sapphire is responsible for the extortion and thieving operations, with any number of rogue crews operating throughout the kingdom.  From the lowly street urchins to the white-collar crews, the Sapphire manages to keep the money flowing and the crimes just under what is tolerable by the governing body.  The Ruby is responsible for the outside contracts asked of the guild.  The Ruby handles contracts from smuggling to assassinations and everything in-between.  The Obsidian is the muscle that ensures all the crews stay in-line and the defender against all outside influences trying to infringe upon their operations.  A number of mercenary groups are on call, with any number of skilled assassins, work to ensurethe guild's interest is upheld.

While criminal activity is frowned upon by the King, an unspoken word between The Crown Jewels and the King's authority is in place.  A line both groups know not to cross unless The Crown Jewels want an army shutting down their operations, or the King wants a knife in the back.  While most people have heard of The Crown Jewels, few know its members, its officers, or the Three ruling stones.
