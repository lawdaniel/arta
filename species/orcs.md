# The Orcs

Of all the freefolk, their tale is one to marvel at. Once seen as brutal monsters, servants of Vorkunn, now they have a kingdom of their own. During the end of the Second Age, when the elves had fallen and the dwarves had turned to piracy; it was the Nanmorians, mightiest of the human kingdoms, and the Orcs, that allied themselves to fight off the undead horde.

The greatest Orc Chieftain of the time was Arrake the wise. He rallied the clans, uniting them under one banner. He learned from the humans and began to institute a system of governance and organization that continues to this day. With the combined might of the orc hosts and the greatest of our kind, and a little help from the Vera, the horde of undead had been defeated. But the Orcs did not disband nor did they dishonor the alliance. The Nanmorians gave unto them a portion of the western lands and the large coastal islands. 

Arrake became emperor and he continued to lead and guide his people in the way of honor and the warrior way. Their kingdom has since flourished, with friendly trade throughout the land. Half-Orcs and Orcs alike are unmatched warriors. They are feared for their prowess in battle and the code of the Orcs by which they live. To this day, the Orc kingdom of Arakan has stood, uniting the once monstrous race and allowing the orcs to be counted among the freefolk of Arta.
