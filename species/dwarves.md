# The Dwarves
It is debated whether the dwarves were the first race or the elves. Both claim that title, but it was the elves that developed the written word first, and so our history is filled with their works. The dwarves of today behave nothing like the dwarves of old. For the dwarves were once masters of stone and metal, with mountain strongholds of impressive design. Most of the great fortresses of this world, the ones that still stand, were crafted by the dwarves long ago. So consumed with their craft were they that none could rival their skill at the forge or the chisel.

That is no longer the case for the dwarves of today as they care less for the craft of metals and stone, and have turned their will towards mastery of the wind and sail. While still masters of metalcraft, they have also created the largest and finest fleet of ships that raid upon the seas. For their strongholds line the coastal waters and their dragonships sail the seas for plunder and loot. They raid coastal town after coastal town with a ferocity of devils. Any who spy upon their ships know to run and take cover. Gone are the days of simple traders and miners, for the dwarven brother bands are to be feared.
