The Elves were once a glorious race. They were said to be the first to walk the lands of Arta. They traveled freely in the wild places of this world, some even walking besides the Vera when they roamed this plane. Much of the history of their people is the stuff of legends, with much lost to history.

They once possessed immortality and an endless wellspring of vitality and grace. Their gifts were the greatest of all the freefolk. That all came to an end in the civil war that occurred between the great Elven houses. This occurred during the second age, culminating in their downfall. None alive now know how they've lost their immortality, and while most elves are still exceptionally long lived into the centuries, they too will one day meet their mortal end.

During the Civil War, many of the great Elven Houses fell, and the loss of elven lives was not easily or quickly replaced. Eventually so much blood was shed, that even the victor of the war was so weakened that other predators came and destroyed the last of the great elven houses. Enslaving all that remained. It is a sad tale to tell, the once powerful elves brought so low, for even today elven slaves are quite common and their kind seen as lesser folk. I am especially disheartened for their half-elven kin as they face an even greater prejudice, derided for their mixed heritage. No Elven cities remain, but there are rumors of small elven enclaves made up of former or escaped slaves, hiding in the deep wilds of this world. Perhaps one day they will reclaim their glory and freedom, or perhaps one day their people will fade into myth and legends.
