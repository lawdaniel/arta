# The Goblins
In my book, The Traveler’s Guide to Arta vol 3, I annotated my review of the city of Grumden. It’s located within the borders of the kingdom of Arakan, ruled by the Goblin King Grumkin. The goblins of this city have sworn fealty to the Emperor, and enjoy the protection of the Orcs. I would like to set the record straight. The children’s tales about goblins are rather unfounded. They are not creatures of the night, hiding beneath your bed and waiting to devour you. They are not savages that eat their own young. They are in fact masters of science! When I visited Grumden, I did not expect to see such innovative marvels. The University of Grumden is known the world over as a place of unparalleled learning and discovery. Unlike the Haven and their brood of witches, that specialize in the study of magic, the university of Grumden studies a branch of science they call Imagineering. I saw horseless carriages moving about, a large contraption that marks paper with words faster than any wordsmith, and most ingenious of all was a device that flushes the poop right out of your room. No more emptying your poop bucket out the window! Though there was some poor fellow marching through the streets complaining of the device. He went on about the device being abominations and how without a poopsmith coming around to collect your poop, we’d all grow too soft from “Flushing” our poop.

What wonders these goblins are and those that follow their methods. Why we might one day do away with magic and find ourselves embracing this science.
