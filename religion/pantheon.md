# Pantheon Overview

Excerpt from The Ordering by the Grand Loremaster Smileious   

“I stood upon the shore of the tractless sea to bear witness upon the ordering of the Vera, who in the tongues of man are called gods. What I witnessed was before the reckoning of time by the Elves. It was the Vera in all their labors. To them was given the task to shape the world and to bring forth Urim’s vision. 
 
To Emberway was given dominion over the sun and the sky, and all winged creatures that soar through the clouds. The soft whispers of the wind or the bellowing gales of the storm are his to command. By the eternal light of Arta’s sun, does his majesty radiantly shine down upon us. To him was given the mantle of leadership of the Vera, until the appointed time. **LG**

To Mronn was given dominion over the burgeoning societies of all the free-folk in all the lands. To him was given the wisdom to judge the righteous from the unrighteous, and the codification of the laws inherent to all. His is the task to bring order from chaos, gathering the freefolk into groups of a few or into many. **LN**

To Mordwen the Corrupter. For in his malice did he create all things that is a mockery of life. It was he that corrupted Vorkuun and Argolin. For by his wicked hand and devious mind did he gain dominion over all that is treachery and death. LE To Aonway was given dominion over all the greenfields, flowering and edible plants, and ageless forests that cover the land. By her beauty and majesty did she tame the heart of Emberway, whose light gives life to all under Aonway’s domain. For by her wild passions and indomitable spirit, did she also command the heart of love. **NG**

To Prayterth was given dominion over stone, rock, and all precious gems beneath. By his hand did he shape the mountains, carve the canyons and ravines, and give richness to all fertile soil. By his craft did he delve deep into Arta, allowing Urim’s flames to flow from cratered mounds and the ground to tremble beneath his feet. **N** 

To Mekomiss the Chronicler, To him was given the labor of bearing witness, and chronicling all the knowledge and experiences of the world. To him flows the essence of magic and the connection to the primal forces that all who wield the arcane can feel. By his silent witness, it is said that Mekomiss will be the last to end his labor, to watch when at last all the countless stars cease. **N**

To Argolin, Lieutenant and mate of Mordwen, whose beauty was said to rival that of Aonway, and whose pride was her downfall. To her was given dominion over healing and the medical arts. In her vain pride and the corrupted whisperings of Mordwen, did she use her will to create the mockery of life. When the end of the first age came, she was cast down into the Abyss to be worshipped by her creations for her broken visage. **NE** 

To Mayimlin, sister of Emberway, was given dominion of the waters of Arta. Her tides washing along the shores of the land, whose fathomless depths hold many secrets, and whose rushing rivers are ever in motion. All the creatures of the sea are of her ilk and of her blessing. It was her wrath and rage that judged and destroyed the Azure city of Nanmor and so endeth the Second Age of Kings. **CG**

To T’Zayadel, the hunter, to him was given dominion over the hunt and of battle. Mighty is he who wields bow, spear, blade, and axe capable of cleaving mountains. In the wild places of this world does he roam. In the chaos of battle and war does he preside. Those who bear witness to his visage say he likens onto that of a wild hairy man, and in the tongues of the wild men of the West, he is called the Vyf. It was he in whom Emberway called, to ride with him into the halls of Mordwen, to throw down the Corruptor. **CN** 

Vorkuun the Defiler, whose might rivaled that of T’Zayadel. To him was given dominion over the dark places of the world. Often, in secret whispers, would Mordwen come to Vorkuun, ever filling him with false wisdom. Vorkuun in his might brought forth an army to lay waste to all the lands of the freefolk. Vorkuun too was cast into the Abyss, to ever Lord in tyranny of the damned. **CE**

There are many other lesser Vera that labor on Arta, but whose allegiance lies with one of the aforementioned.”
