# Al'Yien: The Grey Lord

Not much is known about the Grey Lord, and what is known comes from his (only?) disciple, Gravybelly. This apparent god (the one true god, according to Gravybelly) circles Arta in a flying, silver ship. During the time of his observations, the Grey Lord noticed much suffering in the world. He summoned Gravybelly and entrusted him with the task of healing suffering wherever he saw it.

**DMs Note:** "Hi this is Otel, I'm a KiRin.  Don't tell Gravybelly, but really I'm a celestial being in the service of Aonway.  When I came to him to offer him a gift of divine power, and that I would be his patron, the poor sap was tripping balls on some mushrooms.  How he survived in the woods for so long, as a hermit, without dying, is beyond me.  I flew him over to the river where I dunked him in a few times to shake him out of it, and I might have accidently dropped him.  That tree branch he landed on looked like it hurt a bit as it went up, well, never mind.   Anyways, for laugh I transformed myself into a grey skinned humanoid and gave him my decrees and gifted him with a small divine spark.  Hopefully he lives through his adventures.
