## Campaign 4 Session 4.5 Prompt from Norm
You hop around from one wounded to another, providing what healing you can.  Many of the villagers find it cute and amusing, while others are a bit afraid of a large talking rabbit.  However, your good nature and humble attitude win many over, especially since you lend aid where you can without asking for anything.

You notice the herbalist of the village, Agnes, talking to a pale faced young man.  He is scratching himself repeatedly.  You are curious and wander over to listen.

“It’s okay my dear, drink this slime draught it’ll soothe the ache and I’m going to recommend you take this blue physic twice a day until the itching subsides and all your gross humors are back in balance.”

The young man drinks the thick liquid in one gulp, a look of sour disgust contorts his face from the taste of the medicine.  After a moment a look of relief washes over him.

“Now run along dear and stay away from Janet.” says Agnes with a knowing smile.  She is a kindly older woman, with gnarled hands from age and years at her craft.

“Well my dear, what can I help you with today.” She says as she looks you over.

“Why don’t you just heal him with magic, instead of that Rhubarb concoction,” you ask in all seriousness.  Your nose twitching from the lingering scent.

“Well my dear Harendon, I’m certain magic in the Fey realms, especially healing magic in the Summerlands, is all pervasive.  But here in our world, it is not as common.  And while I could use some magic to heal him, magic doesn’t fix everything.” She taps the side of her head, giving an indication of the thoughts within.

“Speaking of healing, what do you plan to do with your new found friends?” she asks as she tilts her head towards the group of Elven slaves staring at you with awe. “I’m not sure magic can heal what ails their unfortunate lot.” she says with sincerity.
