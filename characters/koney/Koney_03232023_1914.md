## Campaign 4 Session 6.5 Prompt from Norm

It is late in the afternoon.  The sun has moved past its meridian and the heat of the day is at its peak.  The dampness from the sudden summer rains leaves a thickness of moisture and humidity.  The bright light of the sun causes you to squint and shade your eyes, as you peer out into the horizon. The sight is a lush landscape and a balm to your soul.  Looking back, you see that almost everyone is in varying stages of exhaustion.  Sweat dripping from their brows as they exit the barrow.  This will be a slow march back to Fort Vilvidan.  Thankfully everyone is alive.

You offer Alfi a hand as you make your way out of the cavern.  A large gash on her forehead leaves red elven blood streaked across her cheek.  Her hair matted from sweat and blood.  Exhaustion is evident on her ageless face and she is able to keep pace with you.  Though her lithe form is agile and nimble, she takes your proffered hand for support as she steps over a patch of difficult terrain.

“Thank you master Koney.  You and your party have our sincere thanks.” says Alfi as she releases your hand and walks beside you.  You glance back and see Lucian quietly walking a few paces behind you.  You notice his gaze lingering on Callen with his arm around Pearl’s waist, helping her along.  His stoic face, honed through years of servitude,  reveals nothing of his thoughts.
.
“When we get back with my people, I’m afraid a decision will need to be made as to what we will do.”  Alfi’s comment draws your attention back to her.  Lucian’s gaze does not.

“We were not intending to go to Berdusk.  I know our kind do roam “free” there, but I do not trust easily that we would be accepted.  We were hoping to find a place that is safe out here in the wilderness.  Maybe build a small commune where we could live in peace.  But it seems the old tales hold true and dangerous times are ahead.  My people will look to me for answers, these babes of our kind.  They have had to grow up fast in this cruel world, barely 5 decades old some of them are.  I’m not sure what to do master Koney.  I doubt there is anywhere for us.  What do you think we should do?”
