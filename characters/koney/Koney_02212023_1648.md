## Campaign 4 Session 5.5 Prompt from Norm
### Fort Vilvidan

The adventurers gather to leave the townsfolk behind in search of the kidnapped young girls.  The mayor, heeding the persuasive counsel of the halfling agreed to set out for Berdusk as soon as possible.  Agnes the healer offered her services and healed the wounds of the party.

Quietly the elves approach you.  Fearful and weary of the humans in their agitated state, the group approach as humble and unthreatening as they can be.  One draws close and whispers to you.

“Master Harendon, we beseech you.  The monsters have taken Alfilina our leader.  Please help us save her.”

You turn to look at the lot, their heads and their shoulders bowed in trained deference.  Not daring to look you in the eyes.  These are not like the elves you know from the feywild.  The small potted plant in your hands seem to shrink a little from their sadness. 

“I am Lucian.  I am not much of a warrior but I am good at tracking.  I can help if you have need of me!” says the elf, a simple hunting bow and quiver slung over his shoulder.  “Please, help us!  We would be lost without Alfilina.  Without her we will have lost our history!”

You realize she is their loremaster.  Without her they will have lost much of their history!
