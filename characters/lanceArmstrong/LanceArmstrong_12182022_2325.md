## Campaign 4 Session 4.5 Prompt from Norm
Unfastening the last strap of your armor, you pull the chainmail over your head.  You let the heavy weight fall to the ground as you feel a twinge in your side.  Rubbing the aching spot, you peer beneath your gambeson to see a dark purplish bruise and a scabbed over mark along your rib cage.  The very same spot the arrow punched through your armor and struck true.  Even with magical healing the pain doesn’t just disappear.


The blacksmith, Kergan Achart, walks over to you and stoops down to pick up your armor.  Kergan is a short stout man with forearms thicker than yours and a belly from too many ales.  He fingers your armor, his touch confident as he locates the spot of broken rings.

“Looks like you took a good hit, must’ve hurt like a horse kicked ya?”

“Yeah, but I can take it,” you say with confidence.

“I noticed your holy symbol,” Kergan nods to the amulet around your neck.  He pulls out one around his that shows you he too is a follower of Mayimlin.

“You risked your life for us today even though the people of Myrtle were at our ugliest.  I know you’re a Paladin, a vengeance one of the sea god at that, but why? Why put yourself in harms way for a bunch of yolkles or slaves, especially after one stuck you pretty good?
