## Campaign 4 Session 4.5 Prompt from Norm
Unfastening the last strap of your armor, you pull the chainmail over your head.  You let the heavy weight fall to the ground as you feel a twinge in your side.  Rubbing the aching spot, you peer beneath your gambeson to see a dark purplish bruise and a scabbed over mark along your rib cage.  The very same spot the arrow punched through your armor and struck true.  Even with magical healing the pain doesn‚Äôt just disappear.

The blacksmith, Kergan Achart, walks over to you and stoops down to pick up your armor.  Kergan is a short stout man with forearms thicker than yours and a belly from too many ales.  He fingers your armor, his touch confident as he locates the spot of broken rings.

‚ÄúLooks like you took a good hit, must‚Äôve hurt like a horse kicked ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but I can take it,‚Äù you say with confidence.

‚ÄúI noticed your holy symbol,‚Äù Kergan nods to the amulet around your neck.  He pulls out one around his that shows you he too is a follower of Mayimlin.

‚ÄúYou risked your life for us today even though the people of Myrtle were at our ugliest.  I know you‚Äôre a Paladin, a vengeance one of the sea god at that, but why? Why put yourself in harms way for a bunch of yolkles or slaves, especially after one stuck you pretty good?

## Response from Lance 
I nod at Kergan, understanding his question. It's not uncommon for people to question the motivations of a vengeance paladin, especially when they put themselves in harm's way for people who may not deserve it.

"I took an oath to serve Mayimlin and protect the innocent," I explain. "It doesn't matter if they are yolkles or slaves, they are still people and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. And as for the one who struck me with the arrow, I forgive them. It's not my place to seek revenge, but to bring justice and peace. That's what Mayimlin teaches us."
‚ÄúI grew up in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside. Life was simple but happy for me, surrounded by loving parents and a tight-knit community of friends and neighbors.
One fateful night, everything changed. A group of cultists descended upon my village, setting fire to the homes and buildings as they went. I watched in horror as the flames consumed everything I had ever known. My parents were killed trying to defend their home, and my sister was taken by the cultists before they fled into the darkness.
In the aftermath of the attack, I was left alone and devastated. I vowed to track down the cultists and bring them to justice, no matter what the cost. I spent years training in the martial arts and honing my skills as a warrior, determined to be strong enough to take on the cult and rescue my sister.‚Äù

Kergan nods, a look of understanding and respect in his eyes. "I see. Well, I'll get your armor fixed up as soon as I can. And if you ever need anything, don't hesitate to come see me."
I nod and thank Kergan before picking up my armor and heading out of the blacksmith's shop. It's not always easy being a vengeance paladin, but it's a calling that I must fulfill. 

## Response from Norm
Kergan calls to you after an hour or so, beckoning you to come over to his tent.  You grab your halberd and walk over, a chill to the cool night air.  Without your armor you feel lighter and walk with more of a spring to your step.

As you approach you see he has a chest on the ground in front of him.
"I'm sorry Lance, but your armor took some serious damage that will take a long while to fix, longer since I'm not at my forge.  But I thought I offer you something else in its place."

Kergan opens the chest and reaches into it.  Far deeper than the depths of the chest itself.  Some sort of chest of holding you guess.

He pulls out the torso portion of a set of splint armor.  And gently lays it on the ground.  Its design is fairly common, with interlocking plates of armor.

"It's a simple set of splint armor that should fit you fine.  It's a bit of an upgrade over your chainmail, offering a little more protection.  But I do have another offer!" says Kergan with an amused grin.
. 
He reaches into the chest again, only this time he reaches in with both arms.  He pulls out a large box, chains are wrapped around it and a pad lock of some heft secures the chains.  He lifts it out with some effort and drops the box to the ground with some effort.  It clangs with a metallic jangle as it hits the ground.  He fumbles with the lock and chain for several moments before eventually opening the top of the box.

Before you is a set of plate armor.  It's design is of fine make with intricate runes carved throughout.  There is a sense of power in the armor, most certainly magical.

"It's cursed!" Kergan says, snapping you out of your lustful gaze.

"Most assuredly.  I got it about two weeks ago from a passing merchant who practically gave it away.  I don't know what it does and every scroll of identify I've used has failed.  But it's magic aura is pretty powerful.  So I don't know what it does.  So if you want it, its yours.  But I can only give you one, as I'm planning on selling the other in Berdusk to recoup my losses.  So what will it be, splint armor or cursed plate armor?"

## Response from Lance
Lance cautiously looks over the armor.  Looking at the armor he can‚Äôt help but admire the fine craftsmanship put into this armor.  But, there is one detail that catches Lance‚Äôs attention.  His reflection!  ‚ÄúI love how the chest plate makes my hair and skin look flattering!‚Äù  Like a siren‚Äôs call, Lance says YES!

## Response from Norm
Kergan looks at you for a moment, an eyebrow raised.  He appraises your mettle and can't decide if it's courage or something else.

"Brave soul, as you wish master paladin.  Here I'll help you get it on."
It takes several minutes to help don the plate armor, it's shiny plates intricately clicking into place as Kergan fastens the straps.  The weight heavier than the chain mail, but it's bulk already makes you feel more protected.

At last Kergan hands you the helmet to put on.  "Alright, last chance.  You put it on and the cursed armor takes effect.  Did I mention it's cursed?"

You take the helmet from him without hesitation and put it on.  Power courses through you and from you.  Pain wracks your groin region as the attunement takes a firm hold.  At last it ends and you feel a little more tired.  You look up and through the visor you see the look of horror on Kergans face.

"What? What is it?" you ask.

Kergan reaches into his chest and pulls out a full length mirror.  The armor has morphed into a hideous looking black chitinous armor.  In the gaps in the armor you see pulsing veins and glistening red sinew.  You look like a monster!

OOC: you receive Living Plate Armor.    +1 plate, resistance to poison, psychic, and necrotic damage.  Cannot be removed without a remove curse spell.  Symbiotic relationship: after a long rest it drains you if half your HD, or you take a level of exhaustion.  How it drains you I'll leave to your imagination!  Have fun! üòÅ

## Response from Lance
Lance stood in front of the mirror, staring at his reflection in shock and horror. The armor that he had thought would highlight his chiseled jawline had turned him into a monster. He could feel the power coursing through him, but at what cost?

He turned to Kergan, anger and betrayal welling up inside him. "You knew this armor was cursed and you still let me take it? How could you do this to me?"
Kergan held up his hands in defense, a look of fear on his face. "I'm sorry, I didn't know it would do this to you. I thought maybe it would just give you a little extra protection or something. I had no idea it would turn you into this...thing."

Lance couldn't believe what he was hearing. How could Kergan be so selfish and irresponsible? He felt like a pawn in the blacksmith's game, and the thought filled him with rage.

Lance couldn't stand to look at the monster he had become any longer. He grabbed the nearest object, a small wooden stool, and with a roar of anger, he swung it at the mirror. The glass shattered, shards flying everywhere as the mirror fell to the ground in pieces.  Lance covered his face with a hood to hide his monstrous appearance. He knew it was only a matter of time before someone saw him

Taking a deep breath, Lance tried to calm himself. He knew that lashing out further wouldn't solve anything. He needed to find a way to remove this curse and return to his normal form.
He turned to Kergan and said, "I need a remove curse spell. Do you have one or do you know someone who does?"

## Response from Norm
Kergan stoops down to the shattered pieces of the mirror.  With his large and calloused hands he begins gathering the larger portions and piles them together.  There is a sadness to him as he does so.

"I'm sorry master Paladin, but I do not have a remove curse scroll and none but the larger churches or a cleric of some skill can help you."

He cuts himself on a chunk of glass but he ignores it as he continues to sweep together the pieces.  Lance stops to see the handy work of his rage.  Upon reflection a small mirror would likely fetch 5gp or so, but a large full length mirror would likely cost a 100 times as much!  For a small town blacksmith who was forced from his home and workshop, this was a small fortune.  But this was something more, as you notice tears begin to well in Kergan's eyes.

"This was my wife's.  I gave it to her as a wedding gift almost 20 years ago.  I scrapped together almost all I had to buy it at the time, had it crafted custom.  We lived in Myrtle for nearly all our lives.  She passed away almost 2 years ago.  Now Myrtle and my shop are gone as well."  He gathers the pieces into a sack, small cuts bleed slightly, but Kergan ignores the pain as he gently gathers the smaller pieces.

"I'm sorry the armor was so terribly cursed master Paladin, I honestly meant no harm.  Please, leave me be." 

## Response from Lance
Lance's heart went out to Kergan as he watched the blacksmith gather the shards of the shattered mirror. He couldn't imagine the pain and loss that Kergan must be feeling, and he felt guilty for adding to his burden.

He knelt down beside Kergan and helped him gather the remaining shards. "I'm sorry, Kergan. I didn't mean to lose control like that. I know this mirror was special to you, and I'll do whatever I can to make this right.‚Äù

Kergan shook his head and stood up, the sack of shards in his hand. "There's no fixing this, Lance. It's just a reminder of everything I've lost. But I appreciate your help. And I'm sorry for the part I played in your curse. I never meant for any of this to happen."
