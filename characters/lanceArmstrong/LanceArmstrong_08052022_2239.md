“I remember that day. The day I found you.  A soldier in my retinue came running up, and said to me, ‘Master Bronwyn, we’re too late.  Everyone in the village is dead. The tracks are a few days old, at least'

'Not everyone is dead.' I told him.

 When I moved that barrel and saw your frightened face, I praised Mayimlin that someone made it out of that massacre.  You were half starved and terrified.  As we nursed you back to health, we pursued the bastards that had done this, but they eluded us.  We lost their trail and neither heard nor saw any sign of them.

Though you made a full recovery physically, the nightmares continued to plague you.  Others thought it best to leave you in some orphanage, but I saw the fear and anger in you.  Like a raging storm it was, one I felt would turn to evil if left unchecked, and so I opted to train you.  At first you cried at every blow and fall. But I would not give up and neither did you, the constant training hardened you.  The tenets of our order are not for the faint of heart, but the still waters run deep within you.  You have seen evil in this world, and we the Order of the Rising Tide are tasked with washing it all away.

I have received word of a cult operating out of the city of Berdusk.  It may be a wild goose chase, but I promised when I found you, that we would never stop looking.  What I have heard makes me believe this may be a clue into finding the ones responsible.  So go, now is the time to wreak vengeance upon the ones who have destroyed your family.  Go and perhaps give justice to those you have lost. Go and wash away the stain of these evil doers from the face of Arta.

Fair winds and calm seas my child”
