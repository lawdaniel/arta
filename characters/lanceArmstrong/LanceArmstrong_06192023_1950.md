## Campaign 4 Session 10.5 - Prompt from Norm
### The Three Goats Tavern

As the party takes its long rest it is determined wise to keep watch.  During your shift you spend your time checking over your gear and your weapons.  It is still daylight outside, quite a number of hours before night fall.  You find it difficult to sleep as your armor feels even more restrictive than usual.  You can feel your armor attaching itself a little deeper to you.  You take up a spot near the front door.  Nothing is attempting to break it down so you surmise it must be all quiet.

“Yo insect guy?”  Your face plate is down and you notice four of the orc warriors approach you.  They are in decorative chainmail armor, shields slung over their shoulder and their battleaxes hanging from a loop along their belts.  Their hands instinctively resting on the handle of their weapons.  They appear nervous but one takes a step forward in a little more confidence.

You respond with a trilling sound.

“We’ve never seen one like you before.  You fought well out there today!  My buddy and I were wondering what your people are called.  See my buddy thinks he’s heard of a race of insect people called graboids and thinks that’s what you are.  But I figured we just ask.  So, uh, what do we call your people?”

## Response from Lance Armstrong
Lance looks at the group of orc warriors, his face hidden behind the visor of his helmet. He takes a moment to consider their question, grateful for the friendly interaction amidst the tension and danger they all faced.
"We are not called 'graboids'," Lance responds with a hint of amusement in his voice. "We are known as Insecticons! We are more than meets the eye! (Makes Transformers transformation sound)
The orc warriors exchange glances, their curiosity piqued. The one who had taken a step forward speaks again, “Insecticons, huh? Never heard of 'em before. But you fought like a true warrior out there. It's an honor to fight alongside you."
Lance nods, appreciating their words. "Thank you. The honor is mine as well. It's not often that I encounter individuals willing to approach me without fear or prejudice."
The orc warriors smile, a newfound camaraderie forming. "Well, we've fought against our fair share of monsters, so we know that appearances can be deceiving. We judge a warrior by their skill and bravery, not by their looks."
Lance feels a sense of relief and gratitude. In a world filled with fear and prejudice, it's comforting to find understanding and acceptance, even from unexpected sources. He continues to converse with the orc warriors, sharing stories of battles and learning about their own experiences.
As the conversation comes to an end, Lance extends a hand in a gesture of respect. "Thank you for reaching out and asking about my people. It means a lot to me. Let's face the challenges ahead as allies and friends."
The orc warriors clasp his hand firmly, their rough hands a sign of mutual respect. "Allies and friends it is. We'll watch each other's backs."
