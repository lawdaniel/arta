## Campaign 4 Session 14.5 - Prompt from Norm

You feel tired and cold.  Like the last gasps of a flame in a heap of ash.  While the others are discussing the fate of the world, you close your eyes for a quick nap.  They won’t notice if your visor is down and you just stand here.  Your head nods and drift seamlessly into sleep.

You snap awake.  Not sure how long you were asleep but all around you is darkness.  Did the others leave you here?  You lift up your visor and see you are no longer in the pit.  Instead you see the endless night sky, only devoid of the stars.  Your armor writhes and shifts.  It speaks to you from the void.  From the plane of shadows.

“Lance…”  It says in a slow deep stuccato of a voice.  “...what is coming I can protect you.”

“Uhh…I’m a Paladin of the Sea goddess…”

A vision of you burying the dead body of the priest flashes before you.

“You serve a goddess of vengeance and you struck down one of her faithful.” it says, its words like honey.

“I don’t know what happened, that wasn’t me.” you shout out into the void.

“And yet…it was your choice to hide.  Serve me and I will grant you power and protection…all I ask is to be fed…” A cold feeling passes through you.

You awaken.  You are still in the circle with the others, talking to Vananae. You don’t know what is going on and you feel empty inside as the armor feeds on you to sustain itself.  What is happening?
