## Campaign 4 Session 6.5 Prompt from Norm

It is late in the afternoon.  The sun has moved past its meridian and the heat of the day is at its peak.  The dampness from the sudden summer rains leaves a thickness of moisture and humidity.  The bright light of the sun causes you to squint and shade your eyes, as you peer out into the horizon. The sight is a lush landscape and a balm to your soul.  Looking back, you see that almost everyone is in varying stages of exhaustion.  Sweat dripping from their brows as they exit the barrow.  This will be a slow march back to Fort Vilvidan.  Thankfully everyone is alive.

More importantly than everyone making it out alive, is that you have control again of your movements.  It was an unsettling experience when your armor betrayed you.  It seemed to have a mind of its own.  Even more importantly, you haven’t gone to the bathroom since yesterday and you really gotta go.  This cursed heavy armor does have its drawbacks.

As your mind wanders towards how to relieve yourself, you find that the armor begins to respond.  The black chitinous armor begins pulling back from you and allowing an opening in the rear poop shoot.  A slight breeze tickles your bare butt.

Kergan, slowly walking behind you notices.

“Umm Lance, everything ok?”

“Yup! One sec!”  You dash off to a nearby bush, the clunky armor giving you only the barest of openings to perform your defecation.  “Strooooongbottom!!!” you cry out as the business is done.  The armor once again merges together, providing a seamless defense.

“You and I have to get on the same page here cursed armor, you hear me.” You feel no response.

“Lance who are you talking to?” asks Kergan, who has slowed his pace.  “If you’re done, come give me a hand with my armor so I can go behind that bush too!”

You stand, ready to perform your duty as a Paladin, serving and protecting the innocent.
