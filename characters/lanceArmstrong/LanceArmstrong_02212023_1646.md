## Campaign 4 Session 5.5 Prompt from Norm
### Fort Vilvidan

The adventurers gather to leave the townsfolk behind in search of the kidnapped young girls.  The mayor, heeding the persuasive counsel of the halfling agreed to set out for Berdusk as soon as possible.  Agnes the healer offered her services and healed the wounds of the party.

Korgan approaches you.  He is dressed in splint armor wielding a greatsword.  He is not as tall as you but he has the bearing of a warrior.  Mayor Kroft follows behind, he eyes you nervously as they approach.

“The mayor told us you lot suggested we go on without you.  That ain’t happening.  We won’t leave our children behind, and the other parents won’t budge either.”

“I’m sorry Master Paladin, I know Komal-Re suggested we all head to safety but none of the others want to go, most want to head off after those monsters.” says the mayor, his eyes not making contact with your grotesque form.

“I’m not as spry as I used to be but I can still swing a sword.  I can help if you’ll have me.  I’ve got no family left but this village, and I’ll be damned if I let any more harm come to our children.  So what do you say?”

## Response from Lance
Lance looks at Kergan and the mayor, a sense of appreciation welling up inside him. He had noticed that the people of Myrtle were a tough and resilient lot, but he hadn't expected this kind of determination in the face of danger.

He nods at Kergan and says, "We can use all the help we can get. But I have to warn you, this won't be easy. The kidnappers are dangerous and we don't know what kind of traps or ambushes they may have set up."

Kergan nods solemnly, his face determined. "I understand the risks, and I'm willing to take them. We can't let those monsters get away with what they've done."

Lance nods in agreement and turns to the mayor. "We'll need to move quickly and cautiously. And we'll need your help to gather any information about the kidnappers and the area we're heading to."

The mayor nods, looking relieved. "Of course, we'll do whatever we can to help. And Agnes has offered to join us as well, to provide healing and support."

Lance nods in appreciation. "That's good to hear. We'll need all the help we can get. Let's head out, we don't want to waste any more time."

Unless I'm reading it wrong, Agnes isn't going with you guys, just Kergan, Lucian, and Celeste.  She's from Myrtle and is their healer

Oops. I mixed up Agnes and Celeste. 🤦‍♂️
