## Campaign 4 Session 11.5 - Prompt from Norm
### Setting: Temple District, inside Berdusk
### Komal-Re, Aegir, Lance, Living Armor, Dead Queen and Celeste

Within the temple of Mayimlim, the goddess of the seas, you find the decor of a temple seemingly at odds.  The front of the temple is decorated in colors of bright pastels and sea shells.  The scent of a sea breeze on a sunny day is ever present.  As one approaches the altar the colors grow darker in hue and more menacing.  Like a raging tempest on the open ocean, the altar seems the only safe harbor.  Mayimlim’s dual nature is evident in its subtle beauty and serenity, to its terrible and wrathful nature.

You wander down the aisle of the south transept, searching for anything of value.  Several bodies of clergy lay dismembered and strewn about.  They tried to flee but there was no exit on this side of the temple.  The wholesale slaughter fills you with anger and yet a part of you finds it hard to grasp what to even do about it.  Where do you direct your vengeance?

You spot a scroll, clutched in the hand of a clergyman.  The hand is detached from it’s owner, the grip locked from shock and morbidity.  You reach down and with some effort, you pry the fingers off the scroll.  Unfurling it, you notice it is a scroll of remove curse.

Time stands still, your thoughts are not your own.  This living armor fears it, knowing that what you hold would mean its death and your freedom.  Visions of battle and carnage fill you, anger and rage at the monsters that caused this destruction.  The scroll crumples in your grip as the very thought of Mayimlim’s temple being defiled fills you not with anger but with blinding rage.

Komal-Re shouts out in exclamation of amazement at what he has discovered.  You turn and head back the way you came.  What were you doing again?  A scroll lay crumpled on the ground.  Was it important?  Better see what Komal-Re discovered.  The armor grows silent. 

## Response from Lance Armstrong
As Lance holds the scroll of remove curse in his hands, a wave of conflicting emotions washes over him. On one hand, the scroll represents a chance to free himself from the cursed armor that binds him. It offers the promise of returning to his true form, unburdened by the malevolent influence of the living plate.

On the other hand, he can feel the armor's fear and desperation. It knows that the scroll's power could mean its own demise. The visions of battle and carnage that filled Lance's mind earlier serve as a stark reminder of the strength and protection the cursed armor has provided him.

Lance takes a deep breath, torn between the desire for freedom and the sense of duty he feels towards the power that has aided him. He knows that removing the cursed armor could weaken him in the face of the dangers ahead. Yet, he also understands that carrying the burden of the living plate comes at a great cost.

After a moment of reflection, Lance makes his decision. He carefully stows the scroll away, choosing to carry the weight of the cursed armor a little longer. He knows that there will come a time when he must face the consequences of this choice, but for now, he remains committed to his quest for vengeance and justice.

With resolve in his heart, Lance turns to rejoin Komal-Re, his mind focused on the path ahead. The living armor remains silent, its presence a constant reminder of the difficult choices that lie ahead.
