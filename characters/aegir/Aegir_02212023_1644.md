## Campaign 4 Session 5.5 Prompt from Norm
### Fort Vilvidan

The adventurers gather to leave the townsfolk behind in search of the kidnapped young girls.  The mayor, heeding the persuasive counsel of the halfling agreed to set out for Berdusk as soon as possible.  Agnes the healer offered her services and healed the wounds of the party.

You return to your normal size, the rage subsiding and the reactions almost non-existent.  The adventuring party were more amazed at your rage filled change than terrified.

A man and a woman rushes over to you.  Her demeanor is frantic and frenzied.

“Please!  You have to help!  Those things, they took my daughter!  They took Kinzie!”  The woman grabs you by the arm.  While not as strong as you, her grip is fueled by a mother’s concern.  It takes you a moment, but you recognize her.  It’s the woman who sat across from you on the wagon ride, the young girl sitting on her lap must have been Kinzie.  The young girl with the long brown hair and blue eyes.  You look over and see a noble woman talking to the halfling.  Older than Kinzie, with hair and eyes like her.

“Please!  Those things grabbed her and ran off with the others.  I..I..I don’t have much but if you save her you can have this.”  With a bit of a struggle she tugs a crude gold ring off her finger and places it in your hand.  Her wedding ring.  It’s likely not worth more than 5gp, but a few months wages for a simple farmer.

The man standing near her gently tries to pull her back a step from you, seeing the expression on your face.  It’s Ubert by her side.

“Now now Mela, it’ll all be ok.  We just thought maybe you can help.  We saw how you grew in size and took on that monster.  We’ve no right to ask but the others don’t know us or her.  If it’ll help I can come along with my wagon.  Might save some time and a way to bring them back if they’re hurt.”

“Please she’s all I have left in this world, if anything were to happen to her I don’t know what I would do!”

## Response from Aegir
In an instant, Aegir was transported to a memory: two dwarven children drawing symbols in the sand next to big ocean waves. 

A snap of thunder brought her back to reality, and she found herself tracing the pendant of her necklace with her fingers--the pendant which had been carved into the same shape as the symbol she'd seen in her memory. Deep down, Aegir knew what was right. She had to join these strangers in helping to save the girls. 

Forcing the ring back into Mela's had, Aegir yelled, "I don't want your ring!" Turning away, Mela looked as though all the air in the world had disappeared.

Grunting under her breath, knowing better than to yell at a mother who's desperate to save her child, Aegir rumbled, "Fine. I will help to bring back Kinzie, but I will not carry the burden should something more permanent happen to her." Aegir could feel a twinge of rage starting to spark inside, she squeezed the pendant tightly and felt it subside. 

Mela gasped for air now that she could breathe again.
