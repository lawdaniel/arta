## Campaign 4 Session 4.5

Sitting alone in a dark corner of the encampment, near the wooden walls, you remove your mask for the briefest of time to breathe in the fresh night air and to take several bites of food. With your disguise kit returned, you pull out a few tools and instruments to adjust your mask.  Any longer and the mask might have cracked or the strap broken off.  After making some adjustments to your disguise, you put the mask back on, a sense of comfort in spite of the discomfort comes over you.

“You missed a spot Aarakocra, I can see your feathers by your chin.” says the Blademaster, Gideon Beck.  He walks over to you, leaning against the wooden wall of the Palisade.  You are startled by his words and appearance and quickly draw your dagger.  He doesn’t look concerned and simply taps his chin on the same side you now feel a few loose feathers protruding from the mask.  You quickly adjust and tuck the feathers back in.

“What do you want?” You ask, trying to put confidence in your tone.

“To give you my thanks for the rescue.  Didn’t need it though, Lady Katrina, Lady Celeste, and I were in no danger from those elves.  But if we acted, it was possible one of the villagers might have been hurt.  I must admit it was rather amusing watching you all smash your way in.”  Gideon chuckles at the memory.

“Haha, laugh it up.  Didn’t see you lift a finger to help?”

“Looked like you all had it in hand, besides, my task doesn’t involve others, just my two charges.  Let me ask you something though, why the mask? It’s clearly holding you back.” asks Gideon, all humor aside.
