## Prompt from Norm

You received a message from Dunbar several days ago.  It was short and cryptic.  This was your first job and you were not going to pass on this.  The message was simple.  Get to Berdusk, talk to Henrik.  You've been travelling for days, staying clear of the main roads.  The journey has not been easy, taking a wagon would have been quicker, but the risk of discovery too great.

You don't know this Henrik, nor did Dunbar tell you what the job was, but you're hoping its your big break.  You shift your cloak and tighten the straps around your chest.  Those damnable wings keep slipping the bindings.  Luckily none are around to see your hideousness.  You take off your mask for a moment to get a breath of air before continuing.

Berdusk.  You've never been there.  But the thought of your first job wells a sense of excitement within you.  You can't help but to caw out.  The harsh cry is louder than you expected, the sound echoing through the trees.  Other birds answer the caw.  Damn it! You chide yourself for that moment of weakness, as you put back on your mask, tighten the straps even further, and continue your trek north.  It all starts now, everything you have worked for, everything you desire, everything you will do to the ones who have wronged you and your family.  It all starts now.
