## Campaign 4 Session 6.5 Prompt from Norm

It is late in the afternoon.  The sun has moved past its meridian and the heat of the day is at its peak.  The dampness from the sudden summer rains leaves a thickness of moisture and humidity.  The bright light of the sun causes you to squint and shade your eyes, as you peer out into the horizon. The sight is a lush landscape and a balm to your soul.  Looking back, you see that almost everyone is in varying stages of exhaustion.  Sweat dripping from their brows as they exit the barrow.  This will be a slow march back to Fort Vilvidan.  Thankfully everyone is alive.

You help Olive out of the cavern.  Your arm around her waist as you aid her in taking the weight off a twisted ankle that is slowing her down.  She must have sustained it during the forced march by the Chuul.  She has her arm wrapped around you for support, her head leaning into your chest.

“Thank you Callen.  Thank you for coming for us.” she whispers softly.  The exhaustion evident in her voice.   Her hair matted to her forehead from sweat and the heat.  Pearl isn’t much better but nods in agreement.

Your focus is upon this frail young girl in your arms.  It’s anchoring you to the here and now, rather than the terrible visions and pain of the beholder’s mental intrusion.  You glance at Komal-Re, who glances back from his conversation with Lady Celeste.  Those visions of a gargantuan dragon.  Some abominable brain monster on its back controlling it.  Hordes of terrible monsters.  Your thoughts drift to those visions, threatening to engulf you.  A whimper from Olive as a misstep causes her ankle to send shooting pain up her leg.  It pulls you from that abyss as you adjust your grip to ease more of her weight off her ankle.
