# Fort Vilvidan

Fort Vilvidan, situated on a hill and overlooking the great plains, was active for a scant 40 years.  Large Ironwood trees were used for its outer palisades with steel buttresses shoring up the walls.  Minimal comforts were included in the design as the fort was meant as a forward operating base for the Dunarch Imperium almost 300 years ago.  The Imperium has since fallen and the Holy Dunan Empire is all that remains.  A pale shadow of its once vast empire. 

The fort’s importance however is that it marks the farthest western expansion of the Imperium and had been manned by a modest garrison in charge of patrols and establishing trade routes.  During the 40 years of the fort’s active service, six different commanders were in charge of the fort, with the last one in charge for the longest tenure of 20 years.  Though lost to history, snippets of Captain Grimm’s log book remain, and of import is the notation on the 7th day of the 9th month in the year 2145 DC, according to the Dunarchian Calendar, where it details the arrival of a band of explorers.

“7th Day, 9th Month, 2145DC,

Three patrols have returned yesterday whose route took them along the northern road. They reported bandit activity but was unable to locate any clues as to their whereabouts.

Two more patrols along the western path have been dispatched this morning with Sgt. Cristo in charge.  There have been a number of reports of small dog riders roaming the tractless fields.  I highly doubt the veracity of these sightings but maybe the patrols will turn something up.
This morning an unexpected group of 20 mages stopped at the fort to gather news and to resupply.  I briefly questioned them about their intentions in the region and they said that they were venturing northwest towards the uncharted mountain range.  They were looking to settle in that region, and would not comment as to where they came from.  From their speech I would wager from much farther east than the Imperium.  They dressed all in purple with a strange sunburst symbol on their cloaks.

A trooper mentioned they refused inspection but was able to peak past the wagon flaps.  He saw a wooden staff strapped to the bed of their wagon, with heavy chains and multiple padlocks.  The wagon was never unattended.  They’re staying the night before heading out in the morning, something about this group gives me pause, but its only one night and hopefully will be of no trouble.

Fourth File Commander”

Historical records indicate that the fort was destroyed and abandoned on the 12th day of the 9th month in 2145DC.  No records exist of what occurred and no member of the Fourth File had been heard from again.  The fort was abandoned and would later fall under the governance of the kingdom of Aldamere.  To this day, the fort has fallen into disrepair and is unmanned, its primary usage is that of a rest stop for travelers.
