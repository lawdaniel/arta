# The City of Norwall

Norwall is the Northern border of Aldamere, situated in the iron rich mountains that border large tracts of untamed wilderness. I can’t say I relished staying in Norwall very long, it's too damn cold up there in the high mountains. Much of their trade is ore mining in the mountains, shipping iron ore down to Birodi via river pontoons. Hardy folk up in Norwall, with hooch that’ll put hair on ya chest or a little fire in your belly on those long cold nights.
