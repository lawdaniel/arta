# The City of Birodi

Birodi is best known for their steel production, with a number of master craftsmen having founded schools in Birodi. Some say a Birodidian Blade is of such quality that they are just short of a magic blade. Trade with Norwall supplies the iron for their steel forges, while Berdusk is home to numerous trade routes that allow Birodi to send much of their goods abroad.
