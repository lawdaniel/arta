# Kingdom of Aldamere
## Excerpt from the Traveler’s Guide to Arta by Sir Fenton Silvergraft

The Kingdom of Aldamere, located in the Northern Great Plains, is a charming place. The capital city of Aldamere has a manmade castle situated atop a large hill with the surrounding city protected by tall walls and spires. It borders the Serpent’s Tail River to the North and derives much of its economy on trade and river traffic. It's ruled by the good king Alton Eckbert, whom some say has a touch of Elven blood in him, seeing as how he is close to 100 and doesn’t look a day over 60! He has three sons and two daughters, the eldest son Kolton Eckbert, is next in line to take over and rule the kingdom.

The kingdom itself is predominantly human, but nearly all freefolk races can be found within its borders. The one blight upon this great kingdom is that slavery is still legal. While King Eckbert did much to end the slave trade within his borders, he could not muster enough support from the nobility to completely end ownership of slaves.

**Aldamere** boasts three major cities with a large urban population. All three of these cities Birodi, Norwall, and Berdusk, derive much of their economy through river trade. Birodi is best known for their steel production, with a number of master craftsmen having founded schools in Birodi. Some say a Birodidian Blade is of such quality that they are just short of a magic blade. Trade with Norwall supplies the iron for their steel forges, while Berdusk is home to numerous trade routes that allow Birodi to send much of their goods abroad.

**[Norwall](norwall.md)** is the Northern border of Aldamere, situated in the iron rich mountains that border large tracts of untamed wilderness. I can’t say I relished staying in Norwall very long, it's too damn cold up there in the high mountains. Much of their trade is ore mining in the mountains, shipping iron ore down to Birodi via river pontoons. Hardy folk up in Norwall, with hooch that’ll put hair on ya chest or a little fire in your belly on those long cold nights.

**[Berdusk](berdusk.md)** is the second largest city in the kingdom of Aldamere, just after the capital of Aldamere itself. Berdusk sits at the intersection of many road routes, and ships can access the river delta of the Serpent’s Tail, feeding into the Great Sea. It's an important port of harbor for Aldamere, with much of its import and export wealth flowing through this city. As such the population of Berdusk is perhaps the most varied, still predominantly human, but a sizable number of just about every freefolk race call the place home. I must recommend the food in this city, I believe it to be a hotbed of fusion delicacies. Try the raw eel bites the Merfolk make, it's delicious!

To the south of Berdusk are the Endless Plains, one could stand at the top of the south facing spires in Berdusk and see a tract of green plains as far as the eyes can see. I am warned that the Horde roams those areas to the South and I have heeded the warning to stay clear of it. Though one wonders what adventures await in those endless fields of green.
