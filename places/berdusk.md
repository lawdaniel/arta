# The City of Berdusk

Berdusk is the second largest city in the kingdom of Aldamere, just after the capital of Aldamere itself. Berdusk sits at the intersection of many road routes, and ships can access the river delta of the Serpentâ€™s Tail, feeding into the Great Sea. It's an important port of harbor for Aldamere, with much of its import and export wealth flowing through this city. As such the population of Berdusk is perhaps the most varied, still predominantly human, but a sizable number of just about every freefolk race call the place home. I must recommend the food in this city, I believe it to be a hotbed of fusion delicacies. Try the raw eel bites the Merfolk make, it's delicious!

To the south of Berdusk are the Endless Plains, one could stand at the top of the south facing spires in Berdusk and see a tract of green plains as far as the eyes can see. I am warned that the Horde roams those areas to the South and I have heeded the warning to stay clear of it. Though one wonders what adventures await in those endless fields of green.
