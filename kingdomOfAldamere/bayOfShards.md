# Bay of Shards
## Logbook of Captain John Hennidge

On the 15th day, in the 9th month, in the year of our Emperor 2145, I, Captain John Hennidge, of the Imperial Majesty's Service Leopold report the loss of a third of my ship's complement to mutiny.

On the 8th we encountered a terrible squall that battered us most prodigiously.  A lightning strike struck our main mast, bringing our shrouds down to the board, dragging us by the lee.  The sound of the strike was so deafening and blinding that our helmsman reflexively ducked and steered us even more to leeward and into an importune shallow.  The kind with large sharp rocks as The Bay of Shards is so named.  Though I hear the locals call it Lake Tiamat's Tittycaca Bidet.  Also a fitting name after what our ship went through.

Due to the gale and sudden collapse of our main mast, we had no steerage way, causing us to strike upon the rocks with significant speed.  Several prodigiously sounding cracks along the keel could be heard and I feared we were sunk.  The squall was blowing a hard Nor-Nor Easter, pulling us out into open water.

By Mayimlin’s grace we continued to stay afloat, but with the holds rapidly filling with water.  We kept at the pumps unceasingly, yet made no gain in reducing the water level, in fact it continued to rise.  Our carpenter could do nothing to get at the leak as it was situated along the keel.  By the second day, with the water level at nearly 8 feet in the hold, my Leftenant demanded to me that we should abandon ship and fit as many men onto the skiffs as we could.  With the clouds preventing any way of fixing our location and the squall blowing us significantly off course, I deemed it too dangerous to abandon ship in open water.  His arguments were sound, as we did not have a main mast for steerage and the hands could not keep up the pumping indefinitely.  I denied his demand, and threatened to give any man who even thinks of launching the skiffs 20 lashes.
. 
By the end of the third day and our rations all but lost, due to the holds filling up with water.  Fear must have gripped many of the hands, as this is when they mutinied. Led by my Leftenant, they launched our skiffs and fled with a third of our numbers.  They killed three men on deck who tried to stop them and escaped with all of the launches.  With no way to put up sails we could not veer from our course to go after them.  With a third of our numbers and all our launches gone, those of us who remained were set with a grim determination to make it, if nothing else to seek some retribution upon the deserters.

By the beginning of the fourth day was when the Bos’n and the sail maker came up with the idea of sliding our spare mainsail beneath the boat, tightening it the rails.  Thus slowing the leaks and giving our chain pumps a chance.  By now we used what spare spars we had to erect a mast.  It wasn’t much but we could at least raise one of the smaller mizzen sails, giving us some steerage control.  We just needed to slow the water enough until we could make it to land.

I made Bos’n Bondin my new Leftenant and put him to work on his plan.  After three hours and several attempts, it worked!  We secured the mainsail as a kind of diaper along the keel and it was enough to slow the rise of the water.  With all hands taking a turn on the pumps, we were at least able to stem the rise of water.

After two more grueling days of sailing and pumping at all hours, we at last come upon the shores of the Bay of Shards.  We were supposed to arrive five days ago to bring much needed replacements and supplies for Fort Vilvidan, hopefully our delay was not too much an inconvenience.
