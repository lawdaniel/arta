## Description
Greg was a human accountant.  Greg was a rather talented accountant who worked long hours and socialized little.  He had few friends and often spent much of his time alone.  His lack of social skills aided in improving his accounting skills and was garnering Greg much renown for his smooth handling of his client’s financial assets.  Greg prided himself on his integrity and honesty when it came to business dealings and was recognized throughout the city as a trustworthy accountant.

Greg is now a [Brain in a Jar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/194139-brain-in-a-jar-noncore).

### How Greg became a brain in a jar is a tragic tale.
A necromancer who admired Greg’s financial savvy abducted Greg and through various rituals removed his brain and placed it in a sealed glass jar filled with bio-alchemical fluids.  Thus preserving Greg’s brain for all eternity.   This transformation is rather traumatic and some often go insanely mad and just as often develop psionic abilities.

Though the ritual was complete, the necromancer was stopped by a band of wandering murderhobo adventurers.  They rudely broke in and slew the necromancer before he could ask Greg his question on undead-dependent tax filings.  Murderhobo adventurers do what murderhobo adventurers do and looted the place of all its valuables and left Greg alone in a jar.  Normally this time alone would have driven most brains in a jar insane, but Greg being used to being alone found it rather peaceful.  Greg slowly developed his psionic abilities and soon was able to telepathically communicate and compel a few wandering zombies to aid him.  Not knowing what else to do and returning to his body impossible, Greg did what Greg did best, he went back to work as an accountant.
