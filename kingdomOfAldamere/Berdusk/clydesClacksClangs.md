## Description
Clyde is a middle aged goblin of 28  years. His greenish grey skin and red eyes are characteristic for his race but streaks of gray hair around his temples give him a distinguished look for a goblin.  Clyde is generally good natured and friendly, easily amused by children and fascinated by new discoveries.  Clyde’s early years was marked by indentured servitude as a minion for an evil warlord who prized the ingenuity and inventiveness of Clyde’s creations. For nearly a decade did Clyde slave over machines of war and destruction.  His most famous invention was the PowerRam Cradle 3000, (Think Newton’s Cradle only bigger) where a series of enlarged ball bearings, affixed to chains, would smash into any castle wall or gate with devastating force!

It wasn’t until the battle of Pike’s Hollow where a band of adventurers overthrew the Warlord and spared Clyde’s life.  Afterwards Clyde would travel to Berdusk where he set up shop to start anew.  Lesser known of Clyde is that he graduated from the University of Grumden, located in the Goblin city of Grumden.  There he received his doctorate in Engineering and Applied Baking Science. 

Now Clyde spends his days making toys and ingenious kitchen gadgets.  His most popular gadget in Berdusk is known as the whisk.
