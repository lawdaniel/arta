# "Once More Unto the Breach"

You may have heard the legendary stories of The Natural Ones. General Strongbottom and the Great Avenger, Tim Macaw. They slayed the evil Lich, Gal'zu! Their battle raged for 2 days and 3 nights. Mountains were leveled! Their magical feats were seen for miles. But! After that great battle, who went back in and cleared those mines? Mines still filled with gelatinous cubes and spiky traps?

And how can we forget about Koney, Guardian of the Realm and Aegir, Keeper of the Tides. They sailed her mighty ship through The Western Trench and into the Feywild itself! There, they convinced the Prince of Storms to return the Crown of Wind to avert a war that would have surely dried the seas. But! What of the heroic people who crewed that ship? Do you think an ordinary person could have sailed through The Western Trench? Do you believe an ordinary person could have survived the Feywild?

It's almost pointless to bring up the Azure Lord himself, Callen Marks. Children will be hiding under their sheets for a millennia because of his deeds. His fallout with Kala'kaar Re rewrote history on an entire continent. But! What became of their generals? Their assassins?

Like all legends of great people, you never really get the whole story. Our adventure today occurs in a place where such great heroes go to rest. A place where the not-so legendary can live out the rest of their days in peace.

Or so they thought.
