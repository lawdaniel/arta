# "Once More Unto the Breach"

You may have heard the legendary stories of The Natural Ones. General Strongbottom and the Great Avenger, Tim Macaw. They slayed the evil Lich, Gal'zu! Their battle raged for 2 days and 3 nights. Mountains were leveled! Their magical feats were seen for miles. But! After that great battle, who went back in and cleared those mines? Mines still filled with gelatinous cubes and spiky traps?

And how can we forget about Koney, Guardian of the Realm and Aegir, Keeper of the Tides. They sailed her mighty ship through The Western Trench and into the Feywild itself! There, they convinced the Prince of Storms to return the Crown of Wind to avert a war that would have surely dried the seas. But! What of the heroic people who crewed that ship? Do you think an ordinary person could have sailed through The Western Trench? Do you believe an ordinary person could have survived the Feywild?

It's almost pointless to bring up the Azure Lord himself, Callen Marks. Children will be hiding under their sheets for a millennia because of his deeds. His fallout with Kala'kaar Re rewrote history on an entire continent. But! What became of their generals? Their assassins?

Like all legends of great people, you never really get the whole story. Our adventure today occurs in a place where such great heroes go to rest. A place where the not-so legendary can live out the rest of their days in peace.

Or so they thought.

## Things to do before the session
### Level and Backstory
Create a level 12 player character (PC). Norm suggested this to really see me sweat. 

It'll be up to you to decide how long your PC has been at The Open Arms Retreat. The longer you've been there, the better you know the facilities BUT the older you are. It's more a RPing thing.

### Items, Magical and Non-Magical
Choose 5 magical items that your PC came to The Open Arms with. Your PC can have up to 2 rare items, if you wish. However, you might want to consult The Open Arms handbook once more.

From the official handbook of The Open Arms:

>We at, The Open Arms, welcome you to the rest of your life!
>
>Upon registration, all adventurers must surrender all their items and gear to the staff. These items will be stored in The Vault and will be kept there for safe keeping. This is for your safety, as well as the staff and other guests.
>
>However, we at The Open Arms, understand just how attached an adventurer is to their personal gear. For your mental health, each guest will be allowed to keep ONE of their most precious items with them. It can only be jewelry or armor. In other words, no weapons.
>
>If you are worried about the "One Item Policy", don't be! Our proprietary anti-magic field keeps the whole center safe. No one is going to accidentally set their room on fire with a Necklace of Fireball.*

### Sneakiness
PCs will have a chance to roll 1d4 to see how many items they were able to sneak into the home. The number rolled will be number of armor, jewelry, or small weapon they would have attempted to hide on their persons when registering. For each item, also roll Sleight of Hand/straight DEX at DC 12.  Another option is to roll Deception at DC 15. 

We'll be doing this in-person.

### General modifiers to your PC
- -2 to AC
- -1 to STR, DEX and INT 
- +1 on CHA and WIS checks and saves
- Movement speed cut down by 33%

I didn't want to recreate a whole table in markdown so here's a pic. This will also be rolled in-person. For kicks.
